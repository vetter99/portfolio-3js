                </h2>
                <p>After completing my Computer Science degree in 2018, I embarked on my professional journey as a software engineer at State Farm. Throughout my time there, I have been an integral part of a DevOps team responsible for supporting the development of a robust mobile/web application utilized by over 20,000 insurance agents for their business operations. My responsibilities have spanned a wide range of projects, including the development of REST APIs using Java with the Spring Boot framework. Additionally, I have undergone extensive training in CI/CD principles, enabling me to create numerous pipelines and automation services for various tasks. Over the past two years, my focus has shifted towards AWS, where I now serve as an Administrator for a multi-tenant account housing 30+ tenants. I have successfully built multiple full stack applications on AWS, incorporating vital components such as alerting and disaster recovery. All of my cloud solutions adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and are implemented using Terraform. I am proud to hold certifications in both Terraform and AWS.</p>
